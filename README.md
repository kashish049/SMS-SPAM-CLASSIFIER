# 📧 SMS Spam Classifier with Skip-Gram Embeddings & Weighted Voting

A powerful **SMS spam detection system** that uses **skip-gram embeddings** for feature extraction and combines **multiple machine learning models** (SVM, KNN, MLP) with a **weighted voting mechanism** to ensure high accuracy.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Skip-gram embeddings** to extract informative text patterns.
- **Multiple models**:  
  - **Linear SVM**  
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  - **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
- **Weighted Voting System** for better predictions by prioritizing higher-performing models.
- **Preprocessing** with tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Confusion matrix visualization** to evaluate model performance.

## ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kashish049/sms-spam-classifier.git
   cd sms-spam-classifier
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Download NLTK resources:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   nltk.download('wordnet')
   ```

---

## 🎯 Usage
1. **Train Models**:
   Run the training script to fit the SVM, KNN, and MLP models:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

2. **Predict New Messages**:
   Test the system with any SMS message:
   ```python
   from main import predict_with_weighted_voting, models, weights

   message = "Don't forget to submit the project report by tomorrow morning."
   prediction = predict_with_weighted_voting(models, message, weights)
   print(f"Prediction: {prediction}")
   ```

3. **Evaluate Model Performance**:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## 💡 How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Special characters and numbers are removed.
   - Messages are tokenized and stopwords are removed.
   - Words are lemmatized for normalization.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Uses **skip-gram embeddings** with 1-grams and 2-grams to capture meaningful word patterns.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Three models are trained: **SVM, KNN, and MLP**.
   - Each model predicts whether a message is **Spam or Ham**.

4. **Weighted Voting**:
   - Models are assigned **weights** based on their performance.
   - The **final prediction** is made by aggregating weighted votes from all models.

## 📊 Results
| **Model** | **Accuracy** | **Precision** | **Recall** | **F1-Score** |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| SVM       | 98.2%        | 90.1%         | 87.6%      | 91.9%        |
| KNN       | 98.1%        | 88.4%         | 88.4%      | 91.7%        |
| MLP       | 98.3%        | 90.1%         | 90.1%      | 92.0%        |

**Example Prediction Results:**
```
Input: "Congratulations! You've won a $1000 gift card! Call now!"
Prediction: Spam

Input: "Let's meet for lunch tomorrow."
Prediction: Ham
```
